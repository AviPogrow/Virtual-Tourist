- (Done) Images display as they are downloaded. They are shown with placeholders in a collection view while they download, and displayed as soon as possible.
 
- When photos are loading from Flickr, the tap gesture doesn't seem to work. How to fix it?
    

- When a Photo Album View is opened for a pin that does not yet have any photos, it initiates a download from Flickr.?
 
- Once all images have been downloaded, the user can remove photos from the album by tapping the image in the collection view. Tapping the image removes it from the photo album, the booth in the collection view, and Core Data.
 
- The Photo Album view has a button that initiates the download of a new album, replacing the images in the photo album with a new set from Flickr.
