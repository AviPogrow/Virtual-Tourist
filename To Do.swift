 - The code for downloading photos is in its own class, separate from the PhotoAlbumViewController.
 
 - Once all images have been downloaded, the user can remove photos from the album by tapping the image in the collection view. Tapping the image removes it from the photo album, the booth in the collection view, and Core Data.
 
 
 
 
 
 - The Photo Album view has a button that initiates the download of a new album, replacing the images in the photo album with a new set from Flickr.

- When there's no images at a particular location from Flickr, alert user instead of crashing out with "fatal error: Index out of range" in the console

- The map interface doesn't recognize taps after coming back from photoView
 
    * - Add a print statement to tap function to see if taps are registering in the console
